# ButterCMS Voice Search Application

This React.js application was designed to be a clone of the FAQ section of the ButterCMS Knowledge Base. It provides a voice search feature by integrating the Microsoft Azure Cognitive Service through the `microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk` SDK. 

[Read the article](https://buttercms.com/blog/enable-voice-search-using-buttercms-search-api) that explains the steps to build this application.

## Important Notice
This project was created as an example use case of ButterCMS in conjunction with a blog article, [How to Enable Voice Search Using the ButterCMS Search API](https://buttercms.com/blog/enable-voice-search-using-buttercms-search-api/), and will not be actively maintained.

Create a .env file, and store the credentials in the following format:

```bash
REACT_APP_SPEECH_SERVICE_KEY=<COGNITIVE_SERVICE_KEY>
